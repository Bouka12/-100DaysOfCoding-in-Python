# Day 1 - #100DaysOfCoding Challenge, I aim to brush up on my coding skills on Python and practice to be a Python Developer (one of 2022 Goals). As I am a PhD student programming skills are highly important for that alleviate my skills on python is the first step.

# Today following Angela 100 days of coding challenge 
# Day 1 I went through :
# Printing
# Strings
# Debugging
# Python Input Function
# Variables and Variables naming in Python

#1. Create a greeting for your program.
print("Welcome to the Band Name Generator!")
#2. Ask the user for the city that they grew up in.
city_name = print(input(" What's name of the city you grew up in? "))
#3. Ask the user for the name of a pet.
pet_name = print(input("What's your pet's name? "))
#4. Combine the name of their city and pet and show them their band name.
print("Your Band Name could be:\n "+ city_name + " "+ pet_name)
# print("Your band name could be: \n", input(" What's name of the city you grew up in? \n") + input("What's your pet's name? \n"))
#5. Make sure the input cursor shows on a new line, see the example at:
#   https://replit.com/@appbrewery/band-name-generator-end

# Another Way to do so
# Greeting for the program
print("Welcome to the Band Name Generator!")
# Concatenate all the steps in one line of code:
print("Your band name could be: \n", input(" What's name of the city you grew up in? \n") + input("What's your pet's name? \n"))

* 100DaysOfCoding-in-Python
This repository will track my #100DaysOfCoding Challenge, Each day starting from 15/01/2022 I will be uploading a project. 
I aim to brush up on my coding skills on Python and practice to be a Python Developer (one of 2022 Goals). As I am a PhD student 
programming skills are highly important for that alleviating my skills on python is the first step.  I am following Angela 100 days of coding challenge
and her course on Udemy! VERY EXCITED TO LEARN
